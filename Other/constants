Basic Algorithm

    Initialization:
        Load the historical figure of the day from the database.
        Initialize the player's guess count and feedback.
    Guess Submission:
        Receive the playerâ€™s guess.
        Compare the guessed details with the actual historical figure's attributes.
        Update feedback based on the comparison.
    Feedback Logic:
        If the guess is correct, end the game and display a success message with figure details.
        If incorrect, provide clues based on the discrepancy in attributes (gender, occupation, death year, etc.).
    Game Continuation:
        If the maximum number of guesses is reached without a correct guess, reveal the figure and reset the game.
        Otherwise, allow the player to continue guessing based on the feedback.
    Reset/Next Game Preparation:
        Reset the game state at midnight or upon player request to start with a new historical figure.
